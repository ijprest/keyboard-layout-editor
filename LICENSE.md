Notes
-----
* Keyboard-Layout-Editor is free to use, and will remain free to use indefinitely.  
* It is open-source, which allows you to learn from (and contribute to) the tool.
* But it's not permissively licensed!
 * The long-term plan is to eventually open the license up to something really 
   permissive (probably MIT), when the site is closer to feature-complete.
 * In the near-term I would like to avoid forks of the website, since I feel it 
   would cause confusion in the community to have several similar-but-different 
   general-purpose layout editors available.
 * In the meantime, if you have a different use-case in mind that requires a fork 
   (e.g., an editor for a keyboard manufacturer to offer customization options 
   to their customers, integrated with your website and custom branded), then 
   just get in touch and I'll provide you a special license to do so (gratis!).
* I claim no ownership over the input (your keyboard layouts) or output (rendered 
keyboards).  You are free to use the inputs/outputs for any use whatsoever.
